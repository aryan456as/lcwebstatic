                <h2>Understanding Alcoholic Liver Disease</h2>
                <p>
                  Alcoholic liver disease (ALD) results from prolonged and excessive alcohol consumption, leading to liver inflammation and damage. If left untreated, it can progress to more severe conditions, such as cirrhosis or liver failure.
                </p>

                <h2>Stages of ALD</h2>
                <ul>
                  <li><strong>Alcoholic Fatty Liver:</strong> The earliest stage, characterized by fat accumulation in the liver.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alcoholic Hepatitis:</strong> Inflammation of liver tissues, often accompanied by pain and jaundice.</li>
                  <li><strong>Alcoholic Cirrhosis:</strong> The most severe stage, involving extensive scarring and irreversible damage to the liver.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                  Early intervention is key to halting the progression of ALD. Homeopathic treatments focus on promoting liver healing, reducing inflammation, and managing symptoms effectively.
